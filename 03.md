# Types
Types that we've discussed during last lesson:
 * `float64` -- represents a floating point number with high precision;
 * `float32` -- represents a floating point number with lower, but still high precision;
 * `int` -- represents integer numbers;
 * `string` -- represents a sequence of characters (runes in golang).
We also should remember that short assignment operator (:=) would use float64 for all floating point constants; and int for any integers.

# Comments
```
// This is a single line comment
```

```
/* this is
  a mutli-line 
  comment */
```

Comments are ignored by the compiler (not exactly, but for now it's good enough think so).

# Branches

Our programs used to be completely linear -- they were executed from top to bottom. Let's think of some cases where we may want to break this and skip some blocks or smth.

Example of a menu:

```
Options
[1] Convert from km/h to m/s
[2] Convert from m/s to km/h

Please enter your option: _
```

In the following example:

```
if a1 < a2 {
  min, max = a1, a2
} else {
  min = a2
  max = a1
}
```

we use two types of assignments allowed in Golang:

Tuple assignment, where right part is "unpacked" to left. Amount of variables on the left must be the same as on the right sides. E.g.

```
a, b, c = 1, 2, "hello"
```

The other one was a simple assignment e.g. `a = 1`.

In regards to assignments! Please don't forget that these are ASSIGNMENTS, not math expressions!!! So  `a = 5` assigns 5 to the memory cell(s) address by `a`.
 
`a = a + 5`
means that we read the value of `a`, add 5 to it, and write back to `a`.
`a + 5 = 5` doesn't make any sense in Go (or most of other langs), as this is not an assignment!

Operator `==` isn't the same as `=`. `==` is an equality comparison, while `=` is an assignment. `a = "hello"` would assign "hello" as a string to variable `a`, while `a == "hello"` would check whether `a` contains "hello".

Pavel used branching in his program to separate two blocks:
1. where values are equal
2. everything else. this part was already implemented, and we know that we just have to move previous implementation into this block.

```
	if max == min {
		fmt.Println("The numbers are equal.")
	} else {
		if max < min {
			min, max = max, min
		}
		fmt.Println()
		fmt.Println(" Maximum =", max)
		fmt.Println(" Minimum =", min)
	}
```

It still could be achieved with else if, but would require else:

```
if equal {
  print equal
} else if max < min {
  swap 
  print min max
} else {
  // no swap
  print min max
}
```

# if-else statements

```
if <condition> {

} else {

}
```

```
if <condition> {

}
```

```
if <condition> {

} else if <condition> {

} else if <condition> {

} else {

}
```

```
if <condition> {
    if <condition> {

    } else {

    }
} else {

}
```



# Conditions

## What is a condition?

Something that a computer can check, if it's true or not.

## Comparison operators

 * `<` -- less
 * `==` -- equal
 * `<=` -- less or equal
 * `!=` -- not equal
 * `>` -- greater
 * `>=` -- greater or equal.

## Strings
It is possible to compare strings.
Pavel will talk about it a bit later. but as a short info -- a lexicographical order will be used https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexicographical_order.
You cannot compare strings and integers or floats though. Only strings to strings. And integers to integers, and floats to floats.

## Comparison examples

In below examples, assume `n` is `int`.

`n < 6.0` is a correct comparison, because the compiler can convert `6.0` as `float64` to `6` as `int`.

`n < 6.3` is an invalid comparison, because the compiler cannot convert `6.3` to `int`.

One option to make the above comparison valid: `n < int(math.Round(6.3))`>

`5 < 5.0` is a correct comparison, because the compiler can convert `5` as `int` to `5.0` as `float64`.

`int` and `int64` are both integer types, where int64 is explicitly said "64-bit integer", int32 is "32-bit integer". Type `int` is just a shortcut (in this case to int32): https://golang.org/pkg/builtin/#int

`string` is a sequence of characters (runes in golang). Every rune is technically an integer.
which holds a code.

```
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

func main() {
	fmt.Println('A')
	fmt.Println('a')
}

// Prints
65
97
```

## Logical operators

Logical operators in go (and in most modern languages) are "lazy" . It means that it calculates as little as possible.

if we have `a || b`, and `a` is true, there is no need to calculate `b`. If `a` is false, then we have to check `b`.

if we have `a && b`, and `a` is false, then there is no need to evaluate `b`, as the whole statement is false. And if `a` is true, then we must compute `b` to know the result.

Example:

`3 < x <= 5` in human language translates to `3 < x && x <= 5` in Go. `!(3 >= x || x > 5)` is another option.
